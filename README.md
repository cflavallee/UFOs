# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage related to UFO sightings across the world.  The webpage allows users to filter the data table in order to get specific sightings based on user input.  The user can filter through Date, City, State, Country, and/or Shape.

## Results
To begin filtering the table, one needs to enter an input in one or more of the filter fields.  Then, by 'hitting' enter, the table will reset and only the filtered data will show on the table, if any exists with those specific criteria.
