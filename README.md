# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage related to UFO sightings across the world.  The webpage allows users to filter the data table in order to get specific sightings based on user input.  The user can filter through Date, City, State, Country, and/or Shape.

## Results
To begin filtering the table, one needs to enter an input in one or more of the filter fields.  Then, by hitting the enter key on one's keyboard, the table will reload and only the filtered data will show on the table (if any exists with the specified criteria).  The image below shows the table being filtered when "El Cajon" is entered in the City input field.

Once a search is complete, the user can clear the search fields and reset the table back to the full dataset.  The image below shows the table reseting after the "El Cajon" search above was done.
